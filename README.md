The modification is to add support for the Adafruit OLED Breakout Board 16-bit Color 0.96" w/microSD.

   You can put the rest on your windows :-)

7. Any kind of clear acrylic adhesive. I use Weld-On but I'm sure other types work just as well

8. 3mm sheet of clear acrylic for laser cutting

9. Arduino Mega or Mega Mini

   If you decide to use Mega Mini make sure you get the 5V version.

   Note that the Mega Mini pinout for the TTL is not standard so you'll need to run jumpers. I ended up using this

10. Crimp ends and crimpers for the slip ring.

11. Heat shrink tubing and some wire wrap for the finishing touch
