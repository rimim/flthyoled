This is a modified version of the Flthy Holoprojectors v1.8 sketch by Ryan Sondgeroth (aka FlthyMcNsty). The original code can be found here:

The modification is to add support for the Adafruit OLED Breakout Board 16-bit Color 0.96" w/microSD.

Parts List
==========

## This is a list of the parts that I used not the only way to accomplish the same thing

1. [BobC Holoprojector](https://astromech.net/forums/showthread.php?24378-Holo-Projectors-amp-Mount-Control-System-BC-Approved-Various-(Sep-2015)-Open)

2. [R2-D2 HP Slip Ring Mount](http://stage.rebelscum.com/estore/proddetail.asp?prod=R2-D2-HP-Slip-Ring-Mount-1-BobC)

3. [Adafruit OLED Breakout Board 16-bit Color 0.96" w/microSD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/684)

4. [Adafruit NeoPixel Ring 12x](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1643)

   The RGBW versions look to be compatible in size

5. [12 wire slip ring](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1195)

6. [Window Film One Way mirror (non-adhesive)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075GY66SW)

   You can put the rest on your windows :-)

7. Any kind of clear acrylic adhesive. I use [Weld-On](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096TWKCW) but I'm sure other types work just as well

8. 3mm sheet of clear acrylic for laser cutting

9. Arduino Mega or [Mega Mini](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071P8NX6T)

   If you decide to use Mega Mini make sure you get the 5V version.

   Note that the Mega Mini pinout for the TTL is not standard so you'll need to run jumpers. I ended up using this
   [TTL USB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071LT4792)

10. Crimp ends and crimpers for the slip ring.

11. Heat shrink tubing and some wire wrap for the finishing touch
